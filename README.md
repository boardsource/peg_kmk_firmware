# Peg Kmk

Whats kmk? Look at the original [README here](./OLDREADME.md)

## Soooo.... Why is this here?

Well there were a few things we at Boardsource wanted to do with kmk that were not best for the over all health of the project.
No hard feelings and we are still committing upstream as much as we can.
This fork is kept very in-sync with kmk/master

## Well then whats different?

1. This readme.
2. kmk folder is inside of /src
3. we build and distribute a .mpy version of kmk.
   we have a easy way to build .mpy versions simply run `docker compose up`.
4. we dont want your pr.
   Open your pr's in kmk and we will get them here.
5. Features Boardsource makes are added here first.

So really this is a known constant peg supports this version of kmk.
This is the version of kmk frozen into [bs-python](https://github.com/boardsource/bs-python)

## Fin.

In closing "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain." You should not need to know about this but its here and there are reasons. please use, love and contribute to kmk its awesome and the people working on it are great.
